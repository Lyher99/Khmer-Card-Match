# üéØ Full Game Features with Mouse Control + How It Works

---

## 1. **Card Flip Mechanics (Mouse Controlled)**

* **Feature:** Player flips cards by clicking with the mouse.
* **How it works:**

  * Each card is an HTML element with a `click` event listener.
  * On click, the card flips with a smooth 3D CSS animation revealing its front image.
  * If two cards are flipped, further clicks are temporarily disabled until the match check is complete.
  * Matched cards stay revealed and become unclickable.

---

## 2. **Matching Logic**

* **Feature:** Players try to find pairs of matching cards.
* **How it works:**

  * After flipping two cards, the game compares their images or IDs.
  * If matched, cards stay flipped and disabled from further clicks.
  * If not matched, cards flip back after a short delay (e.g., 1 second).
  * Players use mouse clicks to select cards one by one.

---

## 3. **Levels and Difficulty Progression**

* **Feature:** Game difficulty increases with levels.
* **How it works:**

  * Level 1 starts with fewer cards (e.g., 6 cards = 3 pairs).
  * Each level adds more cards (e.g., Level 2 = 12 cards, Level 3 = 18 cards).
  * Cards are shuffled randomly each level.
  * Timer is set per level, and decreases as levels get higher.
  * Player must match all pairs before the timer runs out using mouse clicks to flip cards.

---

## 4. **Timer and Scoreboard**

* **Feature:** Show remaining time, level, and moves made.
* **How it works:**

  * Use JavaScript‚Äôs `setInterval` to count down timer each second.
  * Update timer display on the screen.
  * Track player moves (each pair of flips counts as one move).
  * Display current level, moves, and time left prominently.

---

## 5. **Visual and Audio Feedback**

* **Feature:** Interactive sounds and animations.
* **How it works:**

  * Play click sound when a card is flipped via mouse click.
  * Play success sound on matched pair.
  * Show animation or popup when level is cleared.
  * Visual hover effects on cards to indicate clickable state (e.g., scale up on hover).
  * Cards become semi-transparent or visually distinct when matched to indicate success.

---

## 6. **User Interface and Layout**

* **Feature:** Responsive grid layout and controls.
* **How it works:**

  * Cards arranged in a CSS Grid or Flexbox layout adapting to screen size.
  * Use Bootstrap 5 components for buttons (Start, Restart, Pause).
  * Show level progression and badges on the UI.
  * Mouse hover changes card cursor to pointer to indicate clickable area.

---

## 7. **Rewards and Progress Saving**

* **Feature:** Unlock badges and save progress.
* **How it works:**

  * After completing each level, award badge or title (e.g., ‚ÄúKhmer Memory Master‚Äù).
  * Use `localStorage` to save highest level reached and best scores.
  * On reload, load saved progress to continue from last level.

---

## 8. **Game Flow**

* **Feature:** Clear stages from start to finish.
* **How it works:**

  * Start screen with instructions and Play button.
  * On Play, shuffle cards and set timer.
  * Player uses mouse clicks to flip cards and find pairs.
  * If all pairs matched before timer ends, show level-up popup.
  * Player can proceed to next level or restart.
  * If timer runs out, show Game Over screen with retry option.

---

## 9. **Accessibility & Controls**

* **Feature:** Mouse-focused gameplay.
* **How it works:**

  * Cards are clickable only by mouse clicks.
  * Prevent accidental double clicks by disabling clicks during animations.
  * Hover effects show clearly which cards can be clicked.
